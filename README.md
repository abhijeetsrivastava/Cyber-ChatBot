# Project - Cyber Chatbot
This is the repository for our project Cyber-Chatbot.
## Project Description
For this project, we have investigated the construction of a Cyber Chatbot. A powerful chatbot that can perform menial or repetitive tasks or work along side human analysts could significantly increase the effectiveness of security analysts.
## Collaborators
 * Abhijeet Srivastava (abhisri@udel.edu) <br>
 * Anupam Basu (anupamb@udel.edu) <br>
## Capabilities of the chatbot
 * Answer questions about a file or directly through hash.
 * Ask Cyber/Virus related question to the Cyber-ChatBot.
 * We have used [VirusTotal](http://www.virustotal.com/) API to answer the questions.
 * Some questions are answered via Flask API which is internal to University of Delaware's John Cavazos lab.
 * We have implemented NLP and the questions can be asked in more than one ways.
