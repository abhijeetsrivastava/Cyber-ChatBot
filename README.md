This is the repository for our project Cyber-Chatbot.

Project Description-
For this project, we have investigated the construction of a Cyber Chatbot. A powerful chatbot that can perform menial or repetitive tasks or work along side human analysts could significantly increase the effectiveness of security analysts.

Collaborators- <br>
1- Abhijeet Srivastava (abhisri@udel.edu) <br>
2- Anupam Basu (anupamb@udel.edu) <br>

Capabilities of the chatbot-<br>
1- Answer questions about a file or directly through hash.<br>
2- Ask Cyber/Virus related question to the Cyber-ChatBot.<br>
3- We have used VirusTotal's(http://www.virustotal.com/) API to answer the questions.<br>
4- Some questions are answered via Flask API which is internal to University of Delaware's John Cavazos lab.<br>
5- We have implemented NLP and the questions can be asked in more than one ways.<br>
